# video_generator
This is implementation of convolutional variational autoencoder in TensorFlow library and it is used for video generation.

Also this is my code for the Siraj Raval's coding challenge "How to Generate Images - Intro to Deep Learning #14".

You can find more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-UDwk1U77s&t=2s)

## Overview
For more info about video generation see ipython notebook and for implementation details of conv-variational autoencoder see conv_vae.py.
Data set is created by using ffmpeg tool.
